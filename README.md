## Minimum steps to be tested:
- as an end user, I want to select a brand and a model to submit the form.
- as an end user, I want to select a brand, model and enter a keyword text before submitting the form.

Based on these two cases (or more) you may test the UI and the REST endpoint (`/cars`) but the most important part is the end to end automation tests. Please give us your best shot, this can be all the cases that you find useful to demostrate that the project is safe to release.
